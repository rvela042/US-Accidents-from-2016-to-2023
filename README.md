# Road Traffic Accidents Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a dataset and analysis of road traffic accidents. The data includes detailed information about the accidents, weather conditions, and traffic controls at the time of each accident.

The purpose of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights that can help in improving road safety and traffic management. By understanding what factors lead to road accidents, we can create better safety measures and reduce accident rates.

## Questions for Analysis

1. What is the distribution of accident severity across different states?

   The stacked bar chart created shows the distribution of accident severity across different states. This is a directly proportional relationship. You can say that as the taller a bar is, a higher number of accidents occur in the shown states. The colors represent different levels of severity.
