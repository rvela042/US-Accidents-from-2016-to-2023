# Road Traffic Accidents Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a dataset and analysis of road traffic accidents. The data includes detailed information about the accidents, weather conditions, and traffic controls at the time of each accident.

The purpose of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights that can help in improving road safety and traffic management. By understanding what factors lead to road accidents, we can create better safety measures and reduce accident rates.

## Questions for Analysis

1. What is the distribution of accident severity across different states?

   The stacked bar chart created shows the distribution of accident severity across different states. This is a directly proportional relationship. You can say that as the taller a bar is, a higher number of accidents occur in the shown states. The colors represent different levels of severity.

2. How do weather conditions correlate with the number of accidents?

   The line graph shows the relationship between the average monthly temperature and the total number of accidents per month. There seems to be an indirect proportion via the graph, as the lower the temperature, the more accidents. However, there are different line trends. We see that if the line trends upward as the temperature increases, this might suggest that higher temperatures correlate with more accidents. On the other hand, if the line trends downward, it could indicate that fewer accidents occur as temperatures rise. If the line is relatively flat, this would mean there is no strong linear correlation between temperature and the number of accidents.

3. At what times of day do most severe accidents occur?

   The chart indicates that the frequency of severe accidents varies by the hour of the day, with peaks potentially during morning and evening rush hours.

4. What are the common factors among the most severe accidents?

   This bar chart ranks the most common factors associated with severe accidents, and shows us which factors are most prevalent.

5. How does the accident rate vary throughout the week?

   This chart shows the variation in accident rates across different days of the week (Mon-Sun). Here we can see which days have a higher incidence of accidents compared to others.

6. Is there a significant difference in accident rates between urban and rural areas?

   This bar chart gives us a comparison between the number of accidents in urban versus rural settings, which helps in understanding where accidents occur more frequently. In this case, we see them happen in urban areas mostly.

7. What impact do traffic control features have on accident severity?

   Three charts were created to compare the number of accidents in the presence or absence of traffic signals, stop signs, and junctions. This helps offer insight into the impact of traffic control measures on accident rates. (Only one is displayed, but refer to `Main.ipynb` for more info)

8. Does the length of road closure due to an accident correlate with its severity?

   The scatter plot created suggests a potential relationship between the duration a road is closed due to an accident and the severity of the accident.

9. Are there any seasonal trends in accident occurrences?

   This line chart shows the number of accidents per month, and shows us that there are seasonal trends in accident occurrences.

10. How effective are traffic calming measures in preventing accidents?

    The majority of accidents occur at locations without traffic calming measures such as traffic signals, stop signs, and junctions. This means/suggests that such features contribute to reducing accident frequency to a certain extent.
